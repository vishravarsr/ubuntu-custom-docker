# Brief
The project helps in repacking the ubuntu server 14.04 iso with necessary docker files. Feel free to use the script.

# Steps
* Download and save the Ubuntu 14.04 Server ISO under iso/ directory
* Edit install.sh with appropriate ISO Image name {just one place where we mount the iso}
* Run the shell script: sh install.sh

# Output
You will get an iso file generated in the current project directory which can be installed either in a pc or as a virtual box

# TODO
Download the ubuntu iso as part of installer script
